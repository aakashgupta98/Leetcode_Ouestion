//Here we have to traverse an arrany from starting to array length
//2 variable to keep track of consecuitive ones 
//while traversing if we get 1 then update one variable by one 
// Calculate max of 2 points to find consecuitiveness of ones
//if not get 1 then 2nd variable is zero again

public:
    int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(vector<int>& nums) {
        int count1 = 0;
        int count2 = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++){
            if(nums[i] == 1){
                count2++;
                count1 = max(count2, count1);
